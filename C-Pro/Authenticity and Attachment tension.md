We learn from a young age that to be oneself, to be messy, ugly, needy, and stupid, isn't lovable. Crying because we feel hurt or launching into a temper tantrum is met with the disapproval of our caretakers. Here, we may hear the echoes of Jordan Peterson's parental advice: an angry child should sit by himself until he calms down, then he should be allowed to return to normal life. That means the child wins instead of his anger. The rule is: come be with us as soon as you can behave properly. The child learns to be accepted for not who they are but how they are. Their worth is dictated by their behavior. Later on, we note that being too vulnerable or weird drives away romantic prospects. What we are left with is an ultimatum: you can either be yourself or you can be loved. And so, our relationships become cyclical. We  compromise in the beginning, prioritizing attachment over authenticity. We tuck away ourselves, repressing the emotions that feel closest to us. But this only lasts for a short while. Sooner or later, ugly truths violently  crash through our frozen surface of conformity. We risk a divorce, a breakup, the severing of ties with our family members. And then, after a while, we miss the basic need of belonging, and once again repress who we are to be with others. Is this cycle an inevitability? Can we resolve the tension between authenticity and detachment?
