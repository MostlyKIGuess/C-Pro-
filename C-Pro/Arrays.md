[[C-Pro]]

Collection of a similar data types stored at contiguous memory location. 

contiguous - touching or connected throughout in an unbroken sequence;

```c
int array[5] = {0,1,2,3,4};
char arr[15];
```

here 5 represents the size of the array.
&arr[0] represents the memory address of the array when we print it.



Multidimensional array: It's basically a matrix formed by array.
```c
array[2][3]={{1,3,0},{4,5,6}};
```
That is a array with a grid of 8,8.

To perform functions on array we use [[Algorithms]].
