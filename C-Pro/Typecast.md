Typecasting in C is the process of converting one data type to another data type by the programmer using the casting operator during program design.

[[Implicit Type Cast]]

[[Explicit type cast]]

Those are the two types of type casting.

In C programming, there are 5 built-in type casting functions. 

- **atof():** This function is used for converting the string data type into a float data type.
- **atbol():** This function is used for converting the string data type into a long data type.
- **Itoa():** This function is used to convert the long data type into the string data type.
- **itoba()**: This function is used to convert an int data type into a string data type.
- **atoi()**: This data type is used to convert the string data type into an int data type.
