# C-Pro
- First of all you will need to download obsidian from obsidian.md which works for basically every platform be it windows,mac,android.
- It's an app where you can link your notes and basically create your own wikipedia, so this project aims to achieve just that I will be adding more and more as the course gets ahead even DSA will be included as more stuff I learn, it's basically how I understand Computer programming, If you have 20-30 mins spare time, you should look into how this graph and notes look.

- You might ask, why use obsidian?
  
- To simply put it, it's the same format as how our brain thinks, linking each concepts with one another and you can always just search a concept and look in the graph view for it. 

- To use this notes download the code and extract the folder C-Pro.
- Copy the folder to your Obsidian vault wherever that is located and then when you will open obsidian you will be able to use it :)
